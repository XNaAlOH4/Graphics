# Graphics
Trying to create/recreate something visually in html.

1. Sparkler/ Fireworks?
2. Aurora Borealis
3. Making an object with multiple parts with collision
4. Trying to make a nice looking website?
5. Use SVG?

I don't know what I'm doing hopefully if anyone reads this what I make is not trash.
I will be importing the p5.js Library to assist in case I decide to make 3d graphics.
